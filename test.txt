Hey, it's me!
Children and allowing them the freedom to fail is a fundamental aspect of healthy and holistic parenting.
Just as a fledgling bird must test its wings to learn to fly, children need the space to explore, make mistakes, and grow.
By granting them this freedom, parents empower their children to develop resilience, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills
that are essential for navigating life's challenges.
